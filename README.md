# Brainwave Metrix Solution Internship Task2

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my internship at **Brainwave Metrix Intern Task2**. This repository showcases the projects I completed during my internship, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and sentiment analysis using various tools and techniques. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems through data-driven insights.

## Projects


### Task 2. Social Media Sentiment Analysis (NLP) Twitter
- **Tools Used:** Jupyter Notebook, Python (NLTK, TextBlob, Matplotlib)
- **Objective:** Analyze social media sentiment to gauge public opinion on specific topics, products, or events.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Preprocessing of social media text data (e.g., Twitter).
  - Sentiment score calculation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
  - Visualization of sentiment trends over time.
- **Outcome:** Identified trends in public sentiment, offering valuable insights for marketing and communication strategies.




## Conclusion

# In this project, I used machine learning algorithms for Twitter Sentiments Analysis :

**Logistic Regression:**

- Accuracy: 95%
- 93% people have negative sentiments or racist/sexist tweets
- 7% people have positive sentiments or non racist/sexist tweets

# Number of Negative Sentiments are greater than Positive sentiments

# In top 10 'positive hashtags' or non racist/sexist tweets

- 'love' is highest around 1550.
- 'summer' is least around 40.

# In top 10 'negative hashtags' or racist/sexist tweets

- 'trump' is highest above 130
- 'hate' is least around 40

Logistic Regression slightly performed very well , indicating it was better suited for this dataset. However, The model demonstrated strong performance, confirming the effectiveness of these techniques for Twitter Sentiments Analysis. Future work could explore other advanced algorithms to further improve accuracy.
